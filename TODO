* Take over the world. Go out for Chinese food.
* Make tnef aware of and work fine on system with different 'endian-ness'
* work on integration with VM/RMAIL/GNUS/Mutt &c.
* ELISP version for native decoding.
* texinfo help file
* Make more use out of the MAPI types... perhaps there are other useful
  things in them?

2.x ideas:

reorg:

tnef/
        data    -- contains mapi-names mapi-types &c

        doc     -- obvious

        c
                lib     -- c library for tnef parsing
                port    -- portability (strdup &c.)
                app     -- builds tnef app.

        lisp
                lib     -- lisp library (native)
                ffi-lib -- ffi based library
                port    -- portability code
                app     -- build tnef app.

        tests   -- obvious.


library layout:

tnef data structures

TNEF* create_tnef (filename) 
int parse_tnef(TNEF*) -- basic parsing, does not 'collect files'
int collect_files(TNEF*) -- gets file attributes together in logical units
void destroy_tnef (TNEF*) -- frees memory

hook functions used for when an attribute is read in, when a mapi
attribute is read in, when a file is collected.

large attributes(BINARY &c) will not be read in from the file until
they are needed.
